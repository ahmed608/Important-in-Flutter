```

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location</string>
```

# How to Change Package Name in Flutter

Changing the package name in a Flutter project can be done easily using the `change_app_package_name` package. Follow the steps below to rename your Flutter package.

## **Method 1: Using `change_app_package_name`**
This is the easiest way to change the package name in Flutter.

### **Step 1: Add Dependency**
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
flutter pub add change_app_package_name
```

### **Step 2: Change Package Name**
Run the command below, replacing `com.new.package.name` with your desired package name:
```sh
flutter pub run change_app_package_name:main com.new.package.name
```

This will automatically update the necessary files with the new package name.

### **Step 3: Verify Changes**
After running the command, check that the following files have been updated:
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `android/app/build.gradle`
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/new/package/name/MainActivity.kt` (if using Kotlin)
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/new/package/name/MainActivity.java` (if using Java)
- `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

### **Step 4: Clean and Rebuild Project**
Run the following commands to apply the changes:
```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## **Method 2: Manual Package Name Change**
If you prefer to manually update the package name, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Update Android Package Name**
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and change the `package` attribute:
   ```xml
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       package="com.new.package.name">
   ```
2. Update `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           applicationId "com.new.package.name"
       }
   }
   ```
3. Rename the folder structure inside `android/app/src/main/kotlin/` (or `java/`) to match the new package name.

### **Step 2: Update iOS Bundle Identifier**
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Go to `Runner` > `General` > `Identity` and change the `Bundle Identifier`.
3. Update `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
   <string>com.new.package.name</string>
   ```

### **Step 3: Clean and Rebuild Project**
After making these changes, run:
```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```


# How to Build a Windows App Using Flutter

Flutter allows developers to build high-performance applications for Windows. This guide provides a detailed step-by-step approach to setting up, building, and optimizing a Windows app using Flutter.

---

## **1. System Requirements**
Before you start, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- PowerShell 5.0 or later
- Git for Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 (with C++ development tools)
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)

### **Install Flutter SDK**
Download and extract Flutter from the official site:
```sh
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
```
Add Flutter to the system path and verify the installation with:
```sh
flutter doctor
```
Ensure there are no missing dependencies.

---

## **2. Enable Windows Desktop Support**
Run the following command to enable Windows development in Flutter:
```sh
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
```
Check if Windows support is enabled by running:
```sh
flutter doctor
```
If everything is correctly set up, you should see `Windows (desktop)` listed as a supported platform.

---

## **3. Create a New Windows Flutter Project**
Create a new Flutter project with:
```sh
flutter create my_windows_app
cd my_windows_app
```
To confirm Windows support, list available devices:
```sh
flutter devices
```

---

## **4. Run the Windows App**
To run your Windows Flutter app:
```sh
flutter run -d windows
```
If you encounter issues, try:
```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

---

## **5. Configure Windows-Specific Settings**
### **Modify `windows/runner/main.cpp`**
This is the entry point for the Windows app. You can modify it to adjust behavior or add native functionality.

### **Change the Application Icon**
Replace `windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico` with your own icon.
Then, modify `windows/CMakeLists.txt` to reference the new icon.

### **Customize the Window Size**
Edit `windows/runner/main.cpp` and modify the `CreateAndShowWindow` function:
```cpp
window.CreateAndShow(L"My Windows App", {100, 100, 800, 600});
```

---

## **6. Build the Windows App for Release**
Once development is complete, build the Windows executable:
```sh
flutter build windows
```
This creates an executable in `build/windows/runner/Release/`.

---

## **7. Distribute the Windows App**
### **Package the App**
You can package the app into an installer using `NSIS` or `Inno Setup`:
- **NSIS:** https://nsis.sourceforge.io/
- **Inno Setup:** https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

### **Zip and Share**
Alternatively, zip the `build/windows/runner/Release/` folder and share it directly.

---

## **8. Common Issues & Solutions**
### **Issue: Windows app fails to launch**
**Solution:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed (`flutter doctor`)
- Try running `flutter clean` followed by `flutter build windows`

### **Issue: `flutter run -d windows` does not detect Windows**
**Solution:**
- Run `flutter doctor` to check if Windows support is enabled.
- If missing, enable it using `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`.

### **Issue: Slow performance on Windows**
**Solution:**
- Ensure you are using `release` mode for better performance:
  ```sh
  flutter build windows --release
  ```
- Optimize UI rendering using `const` widgets where possible.

---

## **9. Best Practices for Windows Flutter Apps**
- Use **Platform Channels** to interact with Windows-specific APIs.
- Optimize **state management** with `provider` or `riverpod`.
- Implement **error logging** with `sentry_flutter`.
- Ensure the UI is **responsive** for different window sizes.


---

## ✅ **4. Best Practices in Flutter Development**
- Use **const** for widgets that don’t change to improve performance.
- Organize code into **separate files** for readability.
- Optimize app size by using **WebP images** instead of PNGs.
- Write unit and widget tests using **flutter_test** package.

---

## **Conclusion**
Flutter is an ever-evolving framework, and mastering its commands, packages, and debugging techniques will help you build efficient, scalable applications. Keep experimenting and stay updated with new features! 🚀
