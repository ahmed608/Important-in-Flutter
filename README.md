flutter build apk        # Builds an APK for Android
flutter build ios        # Builds an iOS app
flutter clean            # Clears the build cache
flutter pub get          # Fetches dependencies from pubspec.yaml
flutter pub upgrade      # Updates dependencies to the latest versions
flutter analyze          # Analyzes the project for potential issues
flutter format .         # Formats all Dart files in the project
flutter test             # Runs tests in the project
```

### Dart Commands

## 3. Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: App Stuck on White Screen
**Solution:** Ensure `main()` method calls `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before running `runApp()`.
```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Issue: Dependencies Not Found
**Solution:** Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the required dependencies.

### Issue: Emulator Not Detecting Changes
**Solution:** Try running `flutter clean` followed by `flutter run`.

### Issue: Gradle Build Failing in Android
**Solution:**
- Ensure `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` has a compatible Gradle version.
- Run `flutter doctor` and resolve any missing dependencies.

### Issue: iOS Build Failing
**Solution:**
- Ensure Xcode is installed and updated.
- Run `pod install` inside `ios/` directory.

### Issue: Firebase Not Working on iOS
**Solution:**
- Make sure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is correctly placed in `ios/Runner/`.
- Add `use_frameworks!` in the `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

### Issue: PlatformException in Camera or Location Plugins
**Solution:**
- Add required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android) and `Info.plist` (for iOS).

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location</string>
```

## 4. Best Practices in Flutter Development
- Use **const** for widgets that donâ€™t change to improve performance.
- Organize code into **separate files** for readability and maintainability.
- Use **Dart extension methods** to simplify repetitive tasks.
- Apply **Flutter hooks** to manage state efficiently.
- Optimize app size by using **Flutter WebP images** instead of PNGs.
- Prefer **lazy loading** for large lists to improve performance.
- Write unit and widget tests using **flutter_test** package.
